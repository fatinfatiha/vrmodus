        <h3><strong>What if people could weed the good properties from the bad before they’ve
          even left the house?</strong>  <br> <br>
          By putting the traditional open properties into an immersive online world, VR Modus
          allows our customers to put their clients’ property on sale 24/7. No longer does the
          buyer need to be in the physical location to scout a property – they can now walk
          through the entire property online and, unlike other marketing options, get an
          accurate sense of the physical space and dimensions.
